## Silent teacher

![Opening screen of [SILENT
TEACHER](https://silentteacher.toxicode.fr/).](silentteacher.jpg)

@silent

## How does it work?

-   no instructions

-   no explanations

-   learning by trial and error

-   learning from own mistakes

-   accessible regardless the human language

## Process of discovery

-   questions in logical order

-   correctness is shown

-   on incorrect answer: another question of the same kind

-   multiple incorrect answers to question of the same kind: several
    other questions of the same kind

## What can we learn using SILENT TEACHER?

-   concepts of programming

-   ECMAScript

-   Python

## What about learning math the same way?

-   [Variation Theory](https://variationtheory.com/) (@a2019_variation)

-   [exponentiation](https://nextcloud.tennis24.ee/index.php/s/nXbm4grRNrjfFp9) (@astendaminedocx)

## Variation theory

-   small variation

-   large variation

## Solution for deficit of teachers?

-   human teachers manage content

-   content can be reused

-   human teachers deal with small groups of pupils and mentor

-   other pupils self-study

-   How many pupils can self-study?

-   can be applied efficiently only using computer technology

-   Can everything be learned using variation theory and silent
    teaching?

## The progress

![](Progress of teaching.png)

## Adventurous orienteering games

-   bringing pupils outside classroom

-   physical and mental effort

-   overcoming the limit of using computer technology

- task creation by pupils (@guerrero_2021_expecting)

## Filling in the questionnaire afterwards

![](questionnaire-after.jpg)

-   13

-   learning and unlearning

## Science vs humanity

-   adding visuals, audio

-   complicated to give feedback by computer

## Integrated learning

## Further plans in action

Ruum4 (@orjenteerumismng)

## Conclusions

-   hypothetically efficient using variation theory and silent teaching

-   mostly limited to computer technology

-   both indoors and outdoors

-   only a few learning programs available

-   a comprehensive universal self-learning system expected

-   everyone should find what method suits best to them
