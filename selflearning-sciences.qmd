## Silent teacher

![Opening screen of [SILENT TEACHER](https://silentteacher.toxicode.fr/).](rmd/silentteacher.jpg)

@silent

## How does it work?

- no instructions

- no explanations

- learning by trial and error

- learning from own mistakes

- accessible regardless the human language

## Process of discovery

- questions in logical order

- correctness is shown

- on incorrect answer: another question of the same kind

- multiple incorrect answers to question of the same kind: several other questions of the same kind

## What can we learn using SILENT TEACHER?

- concepts of programming

- ECMAScript

- Python

## What about learning math the same way?

- [Variation Theory](https://variationtheory.com/) (@a2019_variation)

- [exponentiation](https://nextcloud.tennis24.ee/index.php/s/nXbm4grRNrjfFp9) (@astendaminedocx)

## Variation theory

- small variation

- large variation

## Solution for deficit of teachers?

- human teachers manage content

- content can be reused

- human teachers deal with small groups of pupils and mentor

- other pupils self-study

- How many pupils can self-study?

- can be applied efficiently only using computer technology

- Can everything be learned using variation theory and silent teaching?

## The progress

## Adventurous orienteering games

- bringing pupils outside classroom

- physical and mental effort

- overcoming the limit of using computer technology

## Filling in the questionnaire afterwards

![](rmd/questionnaire-after.png)

- 13

- learning and unlearning

## Science vs humanity

- adding visuals, audio

- complicated to give feedback by computer

## Integrated learning

## Further plans in action

Ruum4 (@orjenteerumismng)

## Conclusions

- hypothetically efficient using variation theory and silent teaching

- mostly limited to computer technology

- both indoors and outdoors

- only a few learning programs available

- a comprehensive universal self-learning system expected

- everyone should find what method suits best to them
